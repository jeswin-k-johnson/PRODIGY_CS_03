### OVERVIEW
  This project involves building a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria. The tool evaluates passwords and provides feedback to users on their strength, encouraging the creation of more secure passwords. The criteria include the length of the password, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features

**Password Strength Assessment:** Evaluate the strength of a password based on multiple criteria.

**Feedback Mechanism:** Provide users with feedback on the passwordâ€™s strength, including suggestions for improvement.

**Real-time Evaluation:** Assess passwords in real-time as users type.

## Criteria for Password Strength

**Length:** The number of characters in the password.

**Uppercase Letters:** Presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).

**Lowercase Letters:** Presence of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).

**Numbers:** Presence of at least one numeric character (0-9).

**Special Characters:** Presence of at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.).

## How It Works

### Password Strength Algorithm

The password strength algorithm evaluates passwords based on the following criteria:

**Length:**
- Short passwords are generally weaker.
- Longer passwords are stronger, with 12 or more characters being ideal.

**Character Variety:**
- The more varied the characters, the stronger the password.
- Passwords should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Feedback Mechanism

The tool provides feedback based on the strength of the password:

- **Weak:** If the password is too short or lacks variety in characters.
- **Moderate:** If the password has a reasonable length and some variety but could be improved.
- **Strong:** If the password is long and includes a mix of character types.
- **Very Strong:** If the password is long, includes a mix of character types, and avoids common patterns.
